## ✨ Features

### 🌍 Interactive Tropical Island
- Pan, zoom, and explore a beautifully rendered map
- Click to set source and destination points
- Place dynamic obstacles (accidents, construction zones)

### 🧠 Compare Algorithms Side-by-Side
Visualize and compare performance of:
- **[Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)** - Classic shortest path
- **[Bidirectional Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search)** - Faster point-to-point search
- **[Bellman-Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)** - Handles negative weights
- **BMSSP-Inspired** - Educational multi-source visualization

### 🎮 Dynamic Scenarios
- **Normal Traffic**: Standard pathfinding
- **Emergency Routing**: Priority routes
- **Incident Management**: Navigate around obstacles
- **Random Generation**: Unpredictable challenges

### 🎨 Rich Visual Experience
- Real-time algorithm visualization with color-coded paths
- Performance metrics and comparison charts
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Immersive sound effects powered by Tone.js

### 🟡 BMSSP Performance Simulator

> [!WARNING]
> **Educational Disclaimer:** This is a performance simulator based on BMSSP concepts, not a full implementation of the research algorithm. [Learn more →](docs/bmssp_disclaimer.md)

## 🌟 The Story Behind RouteRush Island

RouteRush Island started as a DSA mini-project but evolved into something much more immersive. Instead of submitting just another console application, I built an interactive tropical island where algorithms come to life.

## 🎨 Algorithms

RouteRush Island implements four pathfinding algorithms, each with unique strengths:

| Algorithm | Speed | Handles Negatives | Best For |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **Dijkstra** | Fast | ❌ No | General shortest path |
| **Bidirectional** | Faster | ❌ No | Point-to-point queries |
| **Bellman-Ford** | Slower | ✅ Yes | Negative weights |
| **BMSSP-Inspired** | Fastest | Educational | Learning concepts |
